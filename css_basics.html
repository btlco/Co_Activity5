                A passion for wellness, community, sustainable design and smiles</h2>



            <p class="paragraph">
                Why do we do what we do? We respect that you, like us, believe that travel can serve a purpose. You want
                us to be honest and keep it real, with genuine actions that merge the two platforms of wellness and
                sustainability to promote personal health, and the health of our planet. Experience something out of the
                ordinary. Feel more alive. Be part of a community. Play. Ultimately reconnect with yourself, others and
                the world around you.

            <h2 class="title">What's the story of Six Senses?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">We’ve grown since our story began in 1995, but we’ve based each chapter on the same
                ambition: to journey beyond destinations into new experiences and cultures, so you feel the purpose
                behind your travels. Whether you’re a guest at one of our hotels or resorts, a residence owner, or
                you’re spending time at one of our spas, you’ll see that being environmentally friendly and socially
                responsible is not just a vague promise. These elements are the magic that brings them all to life,
                while promoting personal well-being, and the health of our planet.
